## AI Projects - Using AI to solve my problems.

### AI Portuguese Tutor

Developed an AI Portuguese Tutor to help me learn Portuguese for my exciting trip to Brazil next year. It has a text-to-speech feature using Google Translate to improve my pronunciation, and I can learn about any topic I choose with the help of the GPT-4 API. I use this as a secondary tool after learning the basics from Duolingo.

### Workout Creator 

Used Open Ai's GPT-4 API to help me build workout planner tailored specifically to my preferences and time constraints. This planner curates exercise routines ranging from 40-60 minutes. Workouts range from strength training, hiit, or cardio.
